**Instant Shoppers**

A chaotic multiplayer physics-driven grocery store simulator built in Unity3D with C#. Players and AI shoppers navigate crowded aisles with shopping carts, colliding, grabbing items, and causing hilarious mayhem.

**Features**

Physics-Based Cart System: Realistic cart mechanics handling collisions between players and AI shoppers.

AI Shopper Behavior: Implemented with Unity NavMesh, including ragdoll transitions and recovery.

Performance Optimization: Refactored mesh/material handling to reduce draw calls and improve framerate by 81%.

Dynamic Shelf Population: Item pooling and placement system for efficient, visually varied store layouts.

Security Guard NPCs: Reactive AI that responds to player actions, adding escalating challenges.

**Tech Stack**

Unity3D (C#) – core game engine and scripting.

NavMesh AI – pathfinding and movement for shoppers/guards.

Custom Physics Systems – ragdoll/cart collision handling.

Optimization Techniques – mesh/material batching, object pooling.
